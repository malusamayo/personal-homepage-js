        <p>
            I've been extremely fortunate to travel as part of my job; I'm even more grateful for the labs and travel grants who have made this possible.
            {' '} Through this, I've discovered my own passion for travel and learned lots about different countries and cultures. 
            {' '} Here's where I've traveled to during my research career and some photos from my travels.
